      <header>Romans 10:12-17 (KJV)</header>
      <p>12. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</p>
      <p>13. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>
      <p>14. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</p>
      <p>15. And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</p>
      <p>16. But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</p>
      <p>17. So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</p>
